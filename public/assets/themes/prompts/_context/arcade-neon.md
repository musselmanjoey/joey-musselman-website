```
I'm creating a retro arcade room in Club Penguin style. The aesthetic combines:
- Club Penguin's soft, cartoonish 2D illustration style
- 80s/90s arcade neon aesthetics
- Cozy gaming den atmosphere

COLOR PALETTE:
- Background: Dark purple (#1a1a2e), deep blue (#16213e)
- Neon accents: Hot pink (#ff00ff), Cyan (#00ffff)
- Warm accents: Orange glow, yellow highlights
- Floor: Dark checkered or arcade carpet pattern

LIGHTING:
- Neon light strips create ambient glow
- Dark but warm and inviting (not scary)
- Neon signs are the main light sources
- Subtle purple/pink mood lighting

I'll describe the exact scene I need. Please maintain this style exactly.
