## Send First (Context Prompt)

```
I'm creating game assets in the EXACT style of Club Penguin (2005-2010 era).

KEY STYLE ELEMENTS:
- 2D flat illustration, very cartoonish and soft
- Soft pastel colors, slightly muted (not oversaturated)
- Clean vector-like shapes with NO harsh outlines
- Rounded, friendly shapes - nothing sharp or angular
- Warm and inviting atmosphere

ROOM PROPORTIONS (for interiors):
- Rooms feel WIDE - you see left wall, back wall, and right wall
- Floor takes up 60%+ of the image (large walkable area)
- Furniture/objects are pushed to the edges and back wall
- Ceiling area is minimal

SNOW/WINTER (for outdoor areas):
- Pristine white snow with subtle blue shadows
- Snow banks frame walkable areas creating a "bowl" effect
- Buildings look integrated into the snowy landscape
- Slight fisheye/curved perspective (cozy, contained feel)

I'll describe the exact scene I need. Please maintain this style exactly.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too realistic** - Should be simple, cartoonish
2. **Hard outlines** - Colors define shapes, not black lines
3. **Oversaturated** - Colors should be soft, muted pastels
4. **Sharp edges** - Everything should be rounded and friendly
5. **Too detailed** - Keep it simple, readable at small sizes
6. **Wrong proportions** - Floor should dominate interiors
